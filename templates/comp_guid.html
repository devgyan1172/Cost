    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0.5</td>
      <td>Very Simple Part (Easy to Design)</td>
      <td>This rating indicates that the part design is straightforward and uncomplicated. It doesn't require any complex features or additional components. Designing the mould for this part should be relatively simple.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Normal Part (Generally Symmetric)</td>
      <td>A rating of 1 suggests that the part is relatively common and exhibits symmetrical characteristics. The mould design should follow standard practices and considerations for ensuring balanced filling and ejection.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>Normal Part (Use of Side Cores, Lifters, Inserts Pins for Adding Features)</td>
      <td>This rating implies that the part design includes some additional features such as side cores, lifters, or pins to achieve certain functionalities or complex shapes. The mould design must account for these features and incorporate the necessary mechanisms for their proper operation.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>Moderately Complex Part</td>
      <td>A rating of 3 signifies that the part design is moderately complex, with features that require careful attention during mould construction. It may involve the inclusion of multiple moving components, intricate geometries, or specific design requirements. The mould construction process should adhere to detailed instructions to ensure the successful production of the part.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>Complex Part, High Features, More Holes, Instruction Need to be Followed</td>
      <td>A rating of 4 indicates that the part design is complex, with numerous features, holes, or intricate details. It requires meticulous adherence to specific instructions during mould construction. The design may involve challenging geometries, tight tolerances, or advanced molding techniques to achieve the desired outcome.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>Very Complex Part, Lots of Features, Large Part Size, High Electrode Requirement, Detailed Design Instructions</td>
      <td>This rating represents the highest level of complexity. The part design is extremely intricate, with numerous features, a large size, and high electrode requirements. The mould design must accommodate the complexity of the part, following detailed design instructions precisely to ensure a successful injection molding process.</td>
